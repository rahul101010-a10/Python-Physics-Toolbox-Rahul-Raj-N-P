In laboratory plasma devices and fusion experiments, instruments measure parameters such as temperature, density, electric fields, and particle energy distributions. Python plays an essential role in processing this data, cleaning noisy measurements, performing numerical calculations, and visualizing plasma behavior over time.\n",

    "For example, simple classification functions can be used to categorize plasma regimes based on temperature, while object-oriented particle models help estimate kinetic energies of electrons and ions in fusion plasmas or space plasmas. These small computational tools serve as foundational components in larger simulation frameworks used to study confinement, instabilities, and energy transport.\n",

This flexibility allows researchers to quickly test theoretical models, analyze experimental data, and simulate plasma dynamics efficiently.
